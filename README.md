# FullStackBankApp

This app is a full stack banking app with an operational database, which records user data and saves it across login occurences, and a fully functional front-end UI.

## Installation

Use npm to install cors 2.8.5, express 4.18.2, firebase 10.4.0, firebase-admin 11.0.0, and mongodb 3.6.23.

```javascript
npm install cors
npm install express
npm install mongodb
npm install firebase
npm install firebase-admin
```

## Usage

Once you initialize npm and install the required dependencies, initialize the project by running the index.js file and running locally on localhost:3000

```javascript
node index.js
```

## Future State

For continued work, I would like to continue updating the UI as well as add features like administrator roles to the security layer.
